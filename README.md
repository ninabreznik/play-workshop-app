# `Portfolio App` Workshop

>This is a workshop app series. We created many focused e-learning apps that can
be used as part of a workshop or for self directed learning.

Learn how to build your `portfolio webpage` using `javascript` with `npm` modules `yo` and `csjs-inject`.
Then connect your portfolio page with your Github profile using `minixhr` module.

See how what you will learn to build in this workshop

**Simple - suitable for beginners.**

## Reuse this workshop_app and create your own workshop!
All you need is to:
- add `links to Youtube videos` that you chose for your workshop
- `link to your chat` or you can leave a WizardAmigos chat if your tutorial is about Javascript, P2P web and self employment/cyber nomadism
- replace a `title and description` and voil√†!
